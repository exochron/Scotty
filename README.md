# Scotty

Scotty is your personal transportation assistant for WoW.
It provides an easy-to-access menu with all your spells, toys or items, which let you teleport to specific locations with just one simple click.

You don't need to know the specific spell names, since the menu directly shows your possible destinations.
The menu is categorized by continents. So you can find your destination more quickly.
If the teleport is on an equippable item in your bag, Scotty automatically equips it and changes it back after usage.
